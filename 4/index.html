    <h1>Hriday Sheth Project 4 â€” Image Warping and Mosaicing</h1>
        <h2>Project Information</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was about learning how to do image mosaicing. We shoot and
                    digitize pictures, recover homographies, warp images, and blend images into a
                    mosaic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By selecting corresponding points between two images, we can compute a homography matrix.
                    The homography matrix does an affine transformation to map points from one image to the
                    corresponding points in the other image. We can then use this homography matrix to warp one
                    image into the perspective of the other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The affine transformation can be used to rectify an image, aka "straighten" it so that a
                    specific part of the image appears flat and the focus of the image. The affine transoformation
                    can also be used to create a mosaic by making one image appear to be in the perspective
                    of another image.
                </p>
