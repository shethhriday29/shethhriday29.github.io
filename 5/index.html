            <p>
                Here, we try image generation via DeepFloyd for different prompts and different
                number of inference steps. We can see that as we increase the number of inference steps,
                the image becomes higher and higher quality.

        <h2>1.1: Implementing the Forward Process</h2>
            <p>
                The forward process in a diffusion model gradually adds noise to a clean image, making it
                progressively noisier as the timestep increases. In this process, you start with a clean image,
                x0. Then, we leverage the `alphas_cumprod` array to control the noise scaling at each timestep.
                At each timestep, the clean image is scaled by a factor depending on the value `alphas_cumprod`
                at the particular timestep, as well as added to by some variance that also depends on the value.
                As a whole, the image becomes progressively noisier as the timestep increases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below, we can see the results of the forward process at several different timesteps, starting
                with the clean image at timestep 0, and ending with the final noisy image at timestep 1000.
                The clean image here is used throughout Project 5A, and is a picture of Berkeley's Campanile.
            </p>

        <h2>1.2: Classical Denoising</h2>
            <p>
                In this section, we use Gaussian blur filtering to attempt to denoise the image.
                This leverages the TensorFlow `gaussian_blur` function. However, we did
                not get good results, as the noise was not removed effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below, we can see the results of classical denoising on the noisy image at different
                timesteps. We can see that as a whole, classical denoising is not that effective, and
                that the larger the timestep is for the noisy image, the worse the denoising is.
            </p>
            <img src="./media/1.2.png">
        
        <h2>1.3: One Step Denoising</h2>
            <p>
                Here, we use a one-step pretrained diffusion model to denoise the image.
                The UNet was trained on a very large dataset of pairs of original and noisy images.
                We can use the model to recover Gaussian noise from a noisy image, and then remove
                the noise to recover something close to the original image. The model was trained
                with text conditioning, and thus we must provide a text prompt embedding when denoising.
                For our example here, we use the phrase "a high quality photo."
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, we can see the results of one-step denoising on the noisy image at different
                timesteps. We can see that as a whole, one-step denoising is much more
                effective than classical denoising. Additionally, the larger the timestep,
                the farther the final result from the original "clean" image.
            </p>
            <img src="./media/1.3.png">
        <h2>1.4: Iterative Denoising</h2>
            <p>
                In 1.3, we noticed the quaality of one-step denoising worsened as the timestep increased.
                In 1.4, we denoise iteratively. There is a formula for an estimate for the image at
                the each timestep, which leverages (1) the values of `alphas_cumprod` at the current and
                previous timesteps, and (2) the model prediction for the clean image at the current timestep,
                (3) the image at the previous timestep, and (4) variance.
            </p>
            <p >
                Just like in 1.3, we use UNet and the prompt "a high quality photo" to estimate noise for 
                each timestep, and use this estimate of noise to make our estimated "clean" image at that timestep.
            </p>
            <p>
                In theory, we could do all timesteps going from T=1000 to T=1, but in practice, we
                can skip some of timesteps with a stride greater than 1. Here, we use a stride of 30, working from 990 back to 0.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below, we can see the results of iterative denoising at every fifth timestep. As we can see,
                the results become progressively less noisy as we iterate.
            </p>
            <img src="./media/1.4.1.png">
            <img src="./media/1.4.2.png">

            <img src="./media/1.4.4.png">
            <img src="./media/1.4.5.png">
            <p>
                Now, we can see the predicted image using iterative denoising, a single denoising step,
                as well as Gaussian blurring, and compare the results.
            </p>

        <h2>1.5: Diffusion Model Sampling</h2>
            <p>
                Here, we can use diffusion modeling to generate new images. We start with a random
                noise vector, and then iteratively denoise it using the model via the prompt
                "a high quality photo." This will help push the randomly generated noise vector
                to something in the subspace of all images that includes realistic images.
                We generate 5 high quality images.
            </p>

            <img src="./media/1.5.5.png">
        
        <h2>1.6: Classifier Free Guidance (CFG)</h2>
            <p>
                Here, we use a technique called Classifier Free Guidance to generate new images.
                At each timestep, in addition to estimating "noise" via the prompt "a high quality photo",
                we also estimate the noise using the empty prompt "". We then take a weighted average of
                the two estimates, with the weighting factor being a scalar. We then use this
                estimated noise to generate good images. Magic happens when the scalar is greater than 1,
                and using a scalar factor of 7 leads to great results.
            </p>
            <img src="./media/1.6.1.png">
            <img src="./media/1.6.2.png">

        <h2>1.7: Image-to-image Translation</h2>
            <p>
                Similar to 1.4, we iteratively denoise images that have noise added to them here.
                However, here we also use the technique of Classifier Free Guidance that we developed to denoise the image.
                As expected, this leads to better results.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, we can see the higher lower the starting index/the higher the initial noise,
                the farther the final clean estimate is from the original image. This is because the
                higher the initial noise, the more variability is introduced throughout the denoising process.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here, we apply the techniques we developed to iteratively denoised both hand-drawn and web images
                that have noise added to them. We can see results below.

            <h3>1.7.2: Inpainting</h3>
            <p>
                Via inpainting, we're able to "fill in" parts of an image that are missing. Here,
                we create a "mask" of images â€” where the mask is set to 1, we keep the image as is. However,
                where the mask is set to 0, we attempt to fill in the missing parts of the image. 
                This inpainting code uses a Stable Diffusion model to iteratively fill
                in missing parts of an image by further refining noise estimates
                at each timestep. Starting with a masked image, it predicts how the missing
                regions should look based on a prompt and blends these predictions with the
                original unmasked areas.

            <h3>1.7.3: Text-conditional Image-to-image Translation</h3>
            <p>
                Here, we do the exact same thing as in 1.7 (guiding an image back from having
                noise to being cleaner), but instead of using a more general prompt like
                "a high quality photo," we become creative and use different prompts. This means
                that as an image is denoised, it becomes closer to the original/clean image
                while also being influenced by the prompt. We can see examples below.
            </p>

        <h2>1.8: Visual Anagrams</h2>
            <p>
                In this part of the project, we create visual anagrams. For each visual
                anagram, the image looks like one prompt when viewed, but looks like another prompt
                when the image is flipped (aka, rotated 180 degrees). The way we do this is very creative.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our process is a lot like CFG, leveraging an estimated noise at the different timesteps
                to make a progressively more clear denoised image. However, to make visual anagrams,
                we generate an estimate for noise for both (1) the image in the original direction, based
                on one prompt, and (2) the image in the flipped direction, based on another prompt. We then
                take the average of the two estimates. We use this estimate of noise to iteratively denoise.
                This leads to a denoised image that looks like the first prompt when viewed in the original
                direction, and looks like the second prompt when viewed in the flipped direction.

        <h2>1.9: Hybrid Images</h2>
            <p>
                Here, we create "hybrid" images that are aligned with one prompt when viewed at closely,
                and another prompt when looked at from a distance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like in 1.8, we use a variation of CFG to iteratively denoise. However, at each
                timestep, we generate an estimated noise for both (1) the image based on the "close" prompt,
                and (2) the image based on the "far" prompt. We then run the first noise estimation through
                a high-pass filter, and the second through a low-pass filter. We then add the two results
                together to get a hybrid image. This is because high frequencies are more visible when viewed
                closely, and low frequencies are more visible when viewed from a distance.
