    <h1>Hriday Sheth Project 3 â€” Face Morphing!</h1>
        <h2>Project Information</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Project 3 was about creating a face morphing animation by warping the shape
                    and blending the colors of two images. The process involved defining corresponding
                    keypoints between two faces, generating a triangulation mesh, and performing an
                    affine warp to compute intermediate frames.
                </p>
        <h2>Image Outputs</h2>
            <h3>Part 1: Defining Correspondences</h3>
                <p>
                    Here, we defined pairs of corresponding points on the two images by hand. The original image is
                    a headshot of me, and the destination image is a headshot of Leonardo DiCaprio.
                </p>

            <h3>Part 2: Computing the "Mid-way Face"</h3>
                <p>
                    Before computing the whole morph sequence, we computed the mid-way face of the two images.

            <h3>Part 3: The Morph Sequence</h3>
                <p>
                    Now, we have the morph sequence of going from the original image to the destination image over 45 frames.

            <h3>Part 4: The "Mean face" of a population</h3>
                <p>
                    We used similar techniques with triangulation to create the mean face of a population of faces. I also morphed
                    a few specific source images to the mean shape. Finally, I morphed my own face to the average shape and morphed
                    the average face into the shape of my face.
                </p>
                <h4>Mean Face:</h4>

                <h4>Select Faces Morphed to Mean Shape:</h4>

                <h4>Mean Face Morphed to My Face:</h4>

            <h3>Part 5: Caricatures: Extrapolating from the mean</h3>
                <p> 
                    Here, we produced a caricature of my face by extrapolating from the population mean I calculated in the last step.
